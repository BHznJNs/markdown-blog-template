# Code Blocks

Use three {``\```}(Back quote) symbol to wrap (To prevent syntax conflict, a space is added to every line).

```markdown
 ```
 some code
 ```
```
```
some code
```

- - -

Add the programming language name after the three back quote to apply the code highlighting. Use ``plaintext``, ``text`` or leave it a space to denote the plain text.

```markdown
 ```python
 print("Hello World!")
 ```
```
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
