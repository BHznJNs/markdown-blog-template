# Introduction

The MarkdownBlogTemplate is a static blog website template that can also be used to build a personal online knowledge base. It allows users to write articles in the easy-to-read and understand Markdown format. Unlike popular static website generators like  [Hexo](https://hexo.io/zh-cn), [Jekyll](https://jekyllcn.com/docs/home/), [Hogo](https://www.gohugo.org/) , MarkdownBlogTemplate can directly read and render Markdown files on the frontend without the need for server-side rendering.

MarkdownBlogTemplate supports ##abundant extra functions of Markdown##:
- ##Code highlights and tables##: Built-in support for table structures and highlighting of codes in multiple programming languages.
- ##Media embedded##: supports special syntaxes for inserting audio and videos.
- ##Independent page embedded##: it is allowed to embed independent page by inlining HTML codes or linking independent HTML file with specific syntax.
- ##Math formula rendering##: LaTeX rendering library [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) integrated, which makes it convenient to insert math formulas.
- ##Charts rendering##: With the help of chart rendering libraries like [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/zh/index.html) and
[flowchart.js](http://flowchart.js.org/), it is allowed to render charts like bar chart, flow chart, gantt chart with Markdown texts.
- ##QRCode generating##: QRCodes can be easily generated with  special Markdown syntax.
